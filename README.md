# Identifying multiscale domains from spatial transcriptomics via graph autoencoder with contrastive learning based on cross-modality and data augmentation
## Overview
We propose GCAST, a graph contrastive autoencoder framework for spatial transcriptomics that seamlessly integrates multimodal SRT data. The framework not only captures spatial gene expression patterns to identify tissue domains but also adapts to datasets with or without histological images and supports the integration of multiple datasets for joint analyses.
